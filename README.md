# AzureIotHubProxy
This is example code to show how to manage an IoT hub from an ASP.Net website. Includes a .net client example. Unmodified, it allows IoT devices to create their own IOT Hub registration through a simple REST api secured by a simple API key. Great for demos! Don't use this for production as it circumvents a few security layers around IOT Hub.
