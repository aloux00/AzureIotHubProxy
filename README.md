# AzureIotHubProxy

This is example code to show how to manage an Azure IoT hub from an ASP.Net website. 

Includes a .net client example. 

Unmodified, it allows IoT devices to create their own IOT Hub registration through a simple REST api secured by a simple API key. 

Great for demos! Don't use this for production as it circumvents a few security layers around IOT Hub.
